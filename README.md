RAWR is a published iOS game where players take on the role of a fish navigating the ocean to collect food while avoiding underwater hazards. Built entirely in Swift, this first iteration represents a fully functional MVP, developed as part of a self-directed "hackathon" challenge to test and grow my app development skills.

All characters and assets were hand-drawn, and the user interface was designed in Figma, making this a fully self-produced game from concept to code to design.
